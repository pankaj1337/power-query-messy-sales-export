# Power Query – Cleaning a Messy Inventory Export

## Overview

This project demonstrates how I transformed a messy, multi-header inventory export into a clean, analysis-ready dataset using Excel Power Query.

The original data had multiple header levels, a wide structure, awkward column names, and product information spread across the table.

Rather than manually cleaning the export, I reshaped the data using Power Query.

## Transformation

### Key Steps

1. Combined ASIN, Item Name and Brand using a temporary delimiter
2. Transposed the table
3. Promoted the appropriate row to headers
4. Unpivoted the remaining columns
5. Split the composite field back into individual fields
6. Renamed and reordered the columns
7. Set appropriate data types

## Final Structure

`ASIN | Item Name | Brand | Group Code | Sub Code | Quantity`

## Key Learning

The biggest lesson from this project was that data cleaning isn't always about fixing individual values.

Sometimes the real problem is the **structure of the data**.

Power Query allowed me to reshape the export into a long-format structure that is much easier to analyze, summarize, and use for reporting.
